/**
 * Classes implementing digests support (MD2, MD5, SHA1, SHA-256/384/512, CRC32, ADLER32)<br>
 * <br>
 *
 *
 * MD5 can be implemented through Fast MD5 implementation, but can be reverted to JVM native digest
 * also.<br>
 * <br>
 *
 * Originally a C library support was optional but it is decided to stay full Java.
 *
 * Recommendation for best performance would be to use FastMD5 if possible for MD5, but for
 * portability to use native JVM digest implementations (so no FastMD5 at all).
 *
 * In order to let you make some choice, here is a short performance reports: (done using java
 * -server option)
 * <ul>
 * <li>File based only: (15 MB file used)</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>FastMD5 in C is almost the fastest (+20%), while FastMD5 in Java is the slowest (-20%) and
 * JVM version is in the middle.</li>
 * <li>If ADLER32 is the referenced time ADLER32=1, CRC32=2.5, MD5=4, SHA1=7, SHA256=11, SHA512=25</li>
 * </ul>
 * <li>Buffer based only: (256 MB buffer used)</li>
 * <ul>
 * <li>JVM version is the fastest (+20%), while FastMD5 in C or in Java are the same (-20% than
 * JVM).</li>
 * <li>If ADLER32 is the referenced time ADLER32=1, CRC32=2.5, MD5=4, SHA1=8, SHA256=13, SHA384=29,
 * SHA512=31</li>
 * </ul>
 * </ul><br>
 * <br>
 *
 * For information, sphlib (http://www.saphir2.com/sphlib/) were compared to native JVM
 * implementation for all those digests, and it appears on small benchmarks (speed from sphlib) that
 * native JVM implementation performs better and that on MD5, FastMD5 performs better than sphlib
 * but less than native JVM.
 *
 * Therefore it is recommended to use native JVM MD5 support if possible.
